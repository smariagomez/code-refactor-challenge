# code-refactor-challenge
Project Title: code-refactor-challenge

This code refactor project was directed at improving the accessibility of preexisting codebase within the context of Agile software development. Semantic markup and alt attributes were introduced. Click links were repaired and adjoining CSS code was edited for improved sequencing and to mitigate redundancy.
